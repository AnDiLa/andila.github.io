**Abstract**
Wearable robots are designed to assist people, thus their operation is based on a highly dynamic human–robot interaction. In order to make this interaction as effective as possible, the design of an exoskeleton is subject to challenging requirements involving its mechanical components prior to the control algorithms. Actuator, transmission, and wearable structure play a crucial role in determining the performance of a wearable robot. Current high-performance exoskeletons leverage a new actuation paradigm, so-called quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuation, to enhance a safe and compliant behavior without renouncing a high torque density.
This chapter goes through the principles behind this new enabling technology and provides demonstrations of its beneficial application on several wearable robots. Three diverse exoskeletal prototypes are showcased, which are designed to assist hip, knee, and back, respectively. Preliminary tests executed on healthy subjects confirm the impactful potential of the QDD actuation scheme: all the devices take advantage of low mechanical impedance, high backdrivability, and high torque to exhibit accurate force tracking during various activities.
