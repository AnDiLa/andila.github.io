title: "Controlling negative and positive power for efficiency enhancement and muscle strain mitigation during squatting with a portable knee exoskeleton"
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/yu2025controlling
excerpt: 'Workers face a notable risk of musculoskeletal injuries when performing squatting tasks. Knee exoskeletons offer a promising solution to mitigate muscle strain through squat assistance. However, existing studies on knee exoskeletons lack a comprehensive study that meets the multifaceted requirements of squatting assistance in terms of portability, efficiency, and muscle strain mitigation. Furthermore, another open research question pertains to the control strategy of squat assistance, which should be adaptable to various postures and cadences for different individuals. In particular, the effect of controlling negative power assistance during the squat-down phase is not studied.'
