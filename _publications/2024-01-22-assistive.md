**Abstract**
This study investigates how access to assistive technologies affects employment and earnings among people with disabilities.
We first document employment and earnings gaps associated with specific impairments and activity limitations using 2017–2021 American Community Survey and 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation data. We then use accommodations data from the 2012, 2019, and 2021 Current Population Survey (CPS) Disability Supplements to examine employment and earnings growth for people with disabilities related both to any, and to technology-based, accommodations. We also provide short descriptions of three developing assistive technologies that assist people with upper body impairments, visual impairments, and anxiety conditions.
Almost all impairments and activity limitations are linked to lower employment and earnings, with especially low employment among people with mobility impairments and particularly low earnings among those with cognitive impairments. About one-tenth of workers with disabilities received any accommodations, and 3–4% received equipment-based accommodations in the 2012–2021 period; these figures increased slightly over the period. The occupations with the highest disability accommodations rates had greater disability employment growth from 2012 to 2021, but disability pay gaps did not decrease more in these occupations. The three developing assistive technologies we describe illustrate the potential to reduce the estimated employment and earnings deficits.
Assistive technology accommodations have potential for improving employment outcomes for people with disabilities.
