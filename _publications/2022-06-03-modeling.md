**Abstract**
State-of-the-art exoskeletons are typically limited by the low control bandwidth and small-range stiffness of actuators, which are based on high gear ratios and elastic components (e.g., series elastic actuators). Furthermore, most exoskeletons are based on discrete gait phase detection and/or discrete stiffness control, resulting in discontinuous torque profiles. To fill these two gaps, we developed a portable, lightweight knee exoskeleton using quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuation that provides 14 N·m torque (36.8% biological joint moment for overground walking). This article presents 1) stiffness modeling of torque-controlled QDD exoskeletons and 2) stiffness-based continuous torque controller that estimates knee joint moment in real-time. Experimental tests found that the exoskeleton had a high bandwidth of stiffness control (16 Hz under 100 N·m/rad) and high torque tracking accuracy with 0.34 N·m root mean square error (6.22%) across 0–350 N·m/rad large-range stiffness. The continuous controller was able to estimate knee moments accurately and smoothly for three walking speeds and their transitions. Experimental results with eight able-bodied subjects demonstrated that our exoskeleton was able to reduce the muscle activities of all eight measured knee and ankle muscles by 8.60%–15.22% relative to the unpowered condition and two knee flexors and one ankle plantar flexor by 1.92%–10.24% relative to the baseline (no exoskeleton) condition.
